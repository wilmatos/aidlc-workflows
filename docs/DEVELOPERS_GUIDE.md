# Developer's Guide

## Running CodeBuild Locally

You can run AWS CodeBuild builds locally using the [CodeBuild local agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/use-codebuild-agent.html). This is useful for testing buildspec changes without pushing to the remote.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- The `codebuild_build.sh` script:

### Basic Usage

1. Setup
- Download the local CodeBuild script and make it executable.
- Send the `GH_TOKEN` environmental GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) into a `./.env` file

```bash
if [ ! -f codebuild_build.sh ]; then
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images/master/local_builds/codebuild_build.sh && chmod +x codebuild_build.sh;
fi;
echo "GH_TOKEN=${GH_TOKEN:-ghp_notset}" > "./.env";
```

2. Iterate

- _Optionally edit the `buildspec-override` value in the `.github/workflows/codebuild.yml` GitHub workflow_
- Update `./buildspec.yml` based on the workflow contents to a local file
- Run AWS CodeBuild build locally with images based on the machine architecture

```bash
cat .github/workflows/codebuild.yml \
    | uvx yq -r '.jobs.build.steps[] | select(.id == "codebuild") | .with["buildspec-override"]' \
    > buildspec.yml
./codebuild_build.sh \
  -i "public.ecr.aws/codebuild/amazonlinux-$([ "$(arch)" = "arm64" -o "$(arch)" = "aarch64" ] && echo "aarch64" || echo "x86_64")-standard:$([ "$(arch)" = "arm64" -o "$(arch)" = "aarch64" ] && echo "3.0" || echo "5.0")" \
  -a "./.codebuild/artifacts/" \
  -l "public.ecr.aws/codebuild/local-builds:$([ "$(arch)" = "arm64" -o "$(arch)" = "aarch64" ] && echo "aarch64" || echo "latest")" \
  -c \
  -e "./.env"
```

## Security Scanners

The [`security-scanners.yml`](../.github/workflows/security-scanners.yml) workflow runs six scanners on every push to `main`, every PR targeting `main`, and on a daily schedule. Each scanner uploads a SARIF report to GitHub Code Scanning (visible under the **Security** tab) and as a downloadable artifact.

All scanners except ClamAV use a **deferred-failure pattern**: the scan always runs to completion and uploads results before the job fails. This ensures findings are recorded even when the build breaks.

### Bandit — Python SAST

**What it detects:** Common security issues in Python code (e.g., use of `subprocess`, `eval`, hardcoded passwords, weak crypto).

**What triggers failure:** Any finding with **high confidence**, at any severity level. See the Bandit configuration in [`.github/workflows/security-scanners.yml`](../.github/workflows/security-scanners.yml) for the exact filters used.

**Scope:** Runs against all tracked Python files in the repository; see [`.github/workflows/security-scanners.yml`](../.github/workflows/security-scanners.yml) for the precise include/exclude patterns.

**How to review findings:**

1. Check the **Code Scanning** alerts in the GitHub Security tab, or download the `bandit.sarif` artifact
2. Each finding includes a Bandit rule ID (e.g., `B603`) and a description of the risk

**How to remediate:**

- **Fix the code** — the preferred approach. Bandit docs list safe alternatives for each rule
- **Suppress inline** — add `# nosec BXXX` (with a justification) to the affected line:
  ```python
  subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)  # nosec B603 — cmd is built from validated config, not user input
  ```
- **Exclude a path** — add to the `exclude` list in `.bandit`

### Semgrep — Multi-language SAST

**What it detects:** Security anti-patterns, dangerous API usage, and code quality issues across all languages using the full Semgrep Registry (`--config=r/all`).

**What triggers failure:** Any finding. On PRs, only **new** findings (vs the PR base commit) trigger failure — pre-existing findings are ignored via `--baseline-commit`.

**How to review findings:**

1. Check **Code Scanning** alerts or download the `semgrep.sarif` artifact
2. Each finding includes a rule ID (e.g., `python.lang.security.dangerous-subprocess-use-audit`) and a link to the rule documentation

**How to remediate:**

- **Fix the code** — follow the rule's suggested fix in the Semgrep Registry docs
- **Suppress inline** — add `# nosemgrep: <rule-id>` to the affected line:
  ```python
  time.sleep(5)  # nosemgrep: arbitrary-sleep — polling for server startup
  ```
  For YAML files:
  ```yaml
  run: exit ${{ steps.scan.outputs.exit_code }}  # nosemgrep: yaml.github-actions.security.curl-eval.curl-eval
  ```
- **Exclude a path** — add the path to `.semgrepignore` (note: the `changed-semgrepignore` audit rule will flag new entries for app-sec review)

### Grype — Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (SCA)

**What it detects:** Known CVEs in project dependencies by scanning lock files, manifests, and container images.

**What triggers failure:** Any vulnerability rated **high or critical** (`fail-on-severity: high` in `.grype.yaml`). Low and medium vulnerabilities are reported but do not fail the build.

**How to review findings:**

1. Check **Code Scanning** alerts or download the `grype.sarif` artifact
2. Each finding includes the CVE ID, affected package, installed version, and fixed version (if available)

**How to remediate:**

- **Upgrade the dependency** — the preferred approach. Check if a patched version exists and update the relevant `pyproject.toml` or lock file
- **Suppress in config** — add an entry to the `ignore` list in `.grype.yaml` with a reason:
  ```yaml
  ignore:
    - vulnerability: CVE-2024-12345
      reason: "only affects server-side XML parsing which we don't use"
  ```
  You can scope to a specific package:
  ```yaml
  ignore:
    - vulnerability: CVE-2024-12345
      package:
        name: "some-package"
        version: "1.2.3"
      reason: "pinned version; affected code path is unreachable"
  ```

> **Note:** Grype is an SCA scanner — it analyzes dependencies, not source lines. There are no inline code comments for suppression; all accepted risks go in `.grype.yaml`.

### Gitleaks — Secret Detection

**What it detects:** Secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys) committed anywhere in the git history.

**What triggers failure:** Any secret not present in the baseline file (`.gitleaks-baseline.json`).

**How to review findings:**

1. Download the `gitleaks.sarif` artifact
2. Each finding identifies the secret type (e.g., `generic-api-key`, `jwt`), file, and commit

**How to remediate:**

- **Rotate the secret immediately** — treat any detected secret as compromised
- **Remove from history** — use `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to purge the secret from all commits
- **Add to baseline** — only for known false positives (e.g., test fixtures with synthetic credentials). Regenerate the baseline:
  ```bash
  gitleaks git --config=.gitleaks.toml --report-path=.gitleaks-baseline.json --report-format=json .
  ```
  Review the updated baseline carefully before committing
- **Allowlist a path** — add a regex to `.gitleaks.toml` under `[allowlist] paths` for files that intentionally contain secret-like patterns (e.g., test credential scrubbers)

### Checkov — Infrastructure as Code Scanning

**What it detects:** Misconfigurations in GitHub Actions workflows and Dockerfiles (e.g., unpinned actions, missing security settings, overly broad permissions).

**Scope:** Only scans `github_actions` and `dockerfile` frameworks (configured in `.checkov.yaml`).

**What triggers failure:** Any check failure, except checks listed in `skip-check`.

**How to review findings:**

1. Check **Code Scanning** alerts or download the `checkov.sarif` artifact
2. Each finding includes a check ID (e.g., `CKV_GHA_7`, `CKV_DOCKER_2`) and a description of the misconfiguration

**How to remediate:**

- **Fix the configuration** — follow the Checkov docs for the specific check ID
- **Suppress inline** — add a comment above or on the affected line:

  In a Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  # checkov:skip=CKV_DOCKER_2:healthcheck not needed for build-only image
  FROM python:3.12-slim
  ```
  In a GitHub Actions workflow:
  ```yaml
  # checkov:skip=CKV_GHA_7:buildspec-override requires user parameters
  - uses: aws-actions/aws-codebuild-run-build@v1
  ```
  Multiple skips on one line:
  ```yaml
  # checkov:skip=CKV_DOCKER_2,CKV_DOCKER_3:reason for both
  ```
- **Skip repo-wide** — add the check ID to the `skip-check` list in `.checkov.yaml` with a comment explaining why

### ClamAV — Malware Scanning

**What it detects:** Malware, viruses, and trojans in repository files using ClamAV's signature database.

**What triggers failure:** Any malware detection (binary pass/fail).

**How to review findings:**

1. Download the `clamdscan.txt` artifact — it contains the full scan log with any infected file paths

> **Note:** ClamAV does not produce SARIF output and does not integrate with GitHub Code Scanning. Results are only available as the text log artifact.

**How to remediate:**

- **Remove the infected file** and investigate how it was introduced
- **Verify the detection** — false positives are rare but possible. Check the ClamAV signature name against known FP databases

### Summary of Failure Thresholds

| Scanner | Fails on | Severity filter | Config file |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Bandit | Any finding with high confidence | All severities | `.bandit` |
| Semgrep | Any finding (PRs: new only) | All severities | `.semgrepignore` |
| Grype | High or critical CVEs | Low/medium don't fail | `.grype.yaml` |
| Gitleaks | Any secret not in baseline | All | `.gitleaks.toml`, `.gitleaks-baseline.json` |
| Checkov | Any check failure | All (minus skipped) | `.checkov.yaml` |
| ClamAV | Any malware detection | Binary pass/fail | None |

### Summary of Suppression Methods

| Scanner | Inline comment | Config-level | Baseline/differential |
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Bandit | `# nosec BXXX` | `.bandit` `exclude` | — |
| Semgrep | `# nosemgrep: rule-id` | `.semgrepignore` | `--baseline-commit` on PRs |
| Grype | _(not applicable — SCA)_ | `.grype.yaml` `ignore` | — |
| Gitleaks | — | `.gitleaks.toml` `allowlist` | `.gitleaks-baseline.json` |
| Checkov | `# checkov:skip=ID:reason` | `.checkov.yaml` `skip-check` | — |
| ClamAV | — | — | — |
